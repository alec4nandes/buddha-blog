Earlier this week I wrote about some <a href="https://suttabasket.com/posts/ud4-1-the-buddhas-advice-for-calming-the-mind.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tips the Buddha gave us to clear our minds</a>. I chose "surrounding yourself with wise friends" to top the list because it's so, so important. The wrong people can drag us down by causing us to act unskillfully, drawing us away from our meditation practice.
</p>

<p>
Every time I think about wise friendships, I think about the sixth chapter of the Dhammapada. This inspiring passage invites us to wake up and take account of the people and pleasures around us. But even though it warns us not to mix with bad friends, <a href="#a-2" class="note-link">[2]</a> it can be difficult to identify personal relationships that are causing us harm. What makes a friend bad, anyways?
</p>

<p>
Bad friends are enablers. They often look past the parts of your personality that are creating bad karma, or worse, they actively support these parts. Wise friends, however, give constructive criticism that makes you a better person in the long term, giving you confidence. <a href="#a-1" class="note-link">[1]</a>
</p>

<p>
Buddhism values the entire religious community as one of its "Three Gems" (the other two gems are the Buddha himself and his teachings). There is an abundance of spiritual wealth in associating with others who cherish these teachings. Are your friends speaking and acting unwisely, easily swayed by the three poisons of desire, hatred, and ignorance? Then they might not be the friends for you.
</p>

<p>
You should, of course, practice all these teachings with compassion, and slamming the door on old friends is cruel. It's worth trying first to be the wise friend, then respectfully parting ways if the other person doesn't value your example. It may hurt, but it's worth it for the reward of "sleeping at ease with [a] clear and confident heart". <a href="#a-3" class="note-link">[3]</a>
